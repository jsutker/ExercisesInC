# Reflection 1

## Written Reflection

Our team used eduScrum fairly loosely, though we did stick to the basic structure. We were able to schedule our learning really well across the sprint, learning the basics before learning our project focus, since we didn't know where to look before learning the basics. This made us fairly prepared for the sprint review, since we frontloaded the readings. We finished our MVP early on, so our new MVP, and thus the rest of the sprint, changed accordingly.

## Exam question

### Q: What are two different types of runtime errors? Describe how one could cause them.

#### A1: Floating point exception

Doing something that doesn't work with math, like dividing by 0

#### A2: Segmentation fault

Trying to read/write from unallocated memory (like something that was in scope in another function but the pointer to that area of memory was passed to another function)

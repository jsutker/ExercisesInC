###How did you each share your individual goals and combine them to form team goals?

We all pretty much had similar goals, so the process went very quickly and easily. Matt and I followed the same path through the subject ideation session (with the topics on the whiteboards), and Gabe had the first two swapped, but was otherwise the same. When we didn't have enough people at the end, we asked Bonnie, and she was all for it. Yay.

###How did your team decide on a scrum master and divide other responsibilities?

None of us had any opinions one way or the other, so we sat there for a bit and talked about it.

###How did you decide what to include and omit from your sprint backlog?

We don't quite have all the answers to our questions about what we should include, so we frontloaded the readings and set a due date for those and a socket programming guide we found for Thursday. On Thursday, we'll be able to reevaluate things and set a more thorough backlog.

###What are you still apprehensive about?

Our ability to stay on track.

Also apparently IPv6.(?)

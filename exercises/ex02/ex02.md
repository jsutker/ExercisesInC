# Exercise 2
## Pointers


1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it
intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as
expected?

It seems to be intended to make an array of size 5 that has the integer 42 in each spot (since `bar()` doesn't get set to anything). If it worked as expected, the output would be:

```
42
42
42
42
42
```

2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?

warning: function returns address of local variable [-Wreturn-local-addr]

It means that the address returned from foo will get overwritten.

3.  Run it.  What happens?  You might get a segmentation fault, or you might get
some strange output.  Can you explain it?  You might find it
helpful to draw a stack diagram.

It printed out the `bar()` array since that overwrote the `foo()` array (since that memory space wasn't saved for `main()`)

4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run
it again.  What happens now?

It returned weird numbers, probably because `bar()` doesn't actually do anything important, so something else overwrote the array instead.

5.  Add comments to the code to explain these experiments and the results,
then check the code in to the repo.

I put the comments above,... whoops.

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!
